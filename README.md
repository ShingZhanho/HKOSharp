# YOU ARE NOW IN BRANCH OF DOCUMENTATION PAGES

Before you editing:

If you are making some minor changes (fixing typos etc.), feel free to do so on the docs branch directly.

If you are trying to make big updates (rebuild pages, change pages structure), you MUST open a new branch, and its name should be something like "docs-update/what-ever-name-you-want-here".

Once again, thank you for contributing to this repo!
